**Description:**  <!-- [300 characters max] --> How can we design a better system or framework for designers to learn and practice inclusive design that creates beautiful, inclusive, and accessible products?

## Project Artifacts

**As-is Scenario:**
<!-- [800 characters minimum] -->
Design practitioners' current accessibility design practice is not sustainable.

**User quote:**

> "Everyone thinks I know what I'm doing, but there's so very little guidance."

**Crucial research findings & methodology:**
<!-- [800 characters minimum, 1920x1080 image minimum]  -->
We initially conducted secondary research to establish a baseline of knowledge in the problem space. Our initial impression of  

**Personas:**
<!-- [300 characters minimum for each persona & 1000x1000 each image] -->
_Debra_ is a visual designer.  She went to design school but had limited exposure to accessibility there.  Her first real exposure to accessibility was during accessibility week in bootcamp.  She wants do design accessibly, but she doesn't know how to, where to find appropriate resources, and does not have adequate support from her team.

**Hills & explanatory reasoning:**
<!-- [300 characters minimum for each hill] -->
1. Debra, a Visual Designer, can find all the relevant information to create accessible interfaces within a single resource.

2. Debra, a Visual Designer, will create accessible designs throughout her design process, reducing the severity and frequency of accessibility reworks.

**Concept**
<!--  [800 characters minimum] -->
We know that designers already work within Carbon, IBM Cloud's design system.  If designers use Carbon components, their designs are approximately 80% accessible.  However, Carbon, as it currently exists, does not make this explicitly clear, nor does it give clear guidance on how to make designs 100% accessible.  Our redesign builds upon the existing Carbon resource, helping visual designers and front end developers to create accessible interfaces and have assurance that their work is fully accessible.

## Concluding Statement & Evaluation
<!-- [1000 characters minimum] -->

**Were our hills met?**

Because our project will not be implemented until after we leave, technically our hills were not met.  However, we believe we have left our sponsor leads with adequate tools and frameworks to ensure that our hills are met in the near future.

**Next Steps:**
<!-- (what still needs to be validated, what opportunities have arisen as you've done usability testing, etc) -->
